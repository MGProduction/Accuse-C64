# Accuse-C64
Accuse implementation for C64 using my WIP Interactive Fiction Engine

This replayable IF game is a derivative work (i.e. I "translated" the original Infom7 script into mine, making changes and adding few things) of David A. Wheeler's game with the same name - released a GPL version 2 or later - that you can find here: https://dwheeler.com/accuse/index.html
